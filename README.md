# Data Science Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analytics and machine learning projects demonstrating proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. Each project includes code, instructions, and a README outlining the goal, dataset, tools, deliverables, and a resume-ready description.

## Projects

1. **Financial Data Dashboard (Business Analytics)**  
   Analyzes stock trends and performance metrics using historical stock data. The project includes functions to download stock prices using `yfinance`, compute moving averages, and plot price trends with moving averages. (Resume line: “Built a financial analytics dashboard using Python, SQL, and Tableau to visualize stock trends and performance metrics.”)

2. **Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning Basics)**  
   Builds a classification model to predict whether a telecom customer will churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and training a logistic regression model. (Resume line: “Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn with 82% accuracy, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification techniques.”)

3. **NYC Housing & Census Data Analysis (Applied Data Analytics)**  
   Compares housing affordability across New York City neighborhoods by merging housing rent data with income data and computing income‑to‑rent ratios. It produces visualizations of affordability by borough. (Resume line: “Analyzed NYC housing and census data using SQL and Python to evaluate affordability trends by borough, producing a visual report on income‑to‑rent ratios.”)

4. **Sentiment Analysis on Reddit (NLP Project)**  
   Uses the Reddit API via PRAW and TextBlob to scrape comments from a subreddit, classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and visualize sentiment trends over time. (Resume line: “Built an NLP pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on Reddit posts, classifying over 10,000 comments with 85% accuracy.”)

5. **Retail Sales Analysis (Excel + SQL Project)**  
   Performs exploratory data analysis on a Superstore retail sales dataset to identify top‑performing products, regions, and profit drivers. It includes SQL‑style aggregations using pandas and charts to visualize sales and profit. (Resume line: “Performed retail sales analysis using SQL and Excel, identifying top-performing categories and regions, and presenting actionable insights.”)
