# Financial Data Dashboard

## Goal
Analyze company financials and stock market data to visualize stock trends, moving averages, and sector comparisons.

## Dataset
This project is designed to work with historical stock prices for companies in the S&P 500. You can use the **S&P 500 Stocks (daily updated)** dataset from Kaggle, which contains stock and company data for the constituents of the index ([www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks#:~:text=Suggestions%20,the%20most%20the%20returns%2C%20components)).

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL (optional, for querying data)
- Tableau or another BI tool (optional for interactive dashboards)

## Deliverable
A Python script that downloads stock data, computes moving averages, and generates time‑series plots for selected stocks. You can import the resulting CSV into a BI tool such as Tableau to build an interactive dashboard.

## Resume Line
“Built a financial analytics dashboard using Python, SQL, and Tableau to visualize stock trends and performance metrics.”

## Usage
1. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib`).
2. Run the `dashboard.py` script. Update the list of tickers and date range as needed.
3. Use the generated plots or exported CSV in your BI tool to create an interactive dashboard.
