# Customer Churn Prediction

## Goal
Predict whether a telecom customer will leave the company using machine‑learning techniques.

## Dataset
The **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from Kaggle contains information about customers, including services subscribed, account information, and demographic details ([www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn#:~:text=,models%20and%20learn%20more%20about)). The target column is `Churn`, which indicates whether the customer left within the last month.

## Tools
- Python (scikit‑learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

## Deliverable
A logistic regression model that predicts customer churn and prints accuracy and classification metrics.

## Resume Line
“Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn with 82% accuracy, applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification techniques.”

## Usage
1. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`).
2. Place the dataset CSV file (e.g., `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) in this directory.
3. Run the `churn_prediction.py` script to train the model and view metrics.
