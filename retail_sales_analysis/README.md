# Retail Sales Analysis

## Goal
Identify sales patterns, top‑performing products, regions, and profit drivers in a retail dataset.

## Dataset
Use the **Superstore Sales** dataset from Kaggle, which provides 4 years of sales data for a global superstore ([www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting#:~:text=Retail%20dataset%20of%20a%20global,EDA%20and%20Predict%20the%20sales)). The dataset includes information about orders, products, customers, sales, quantity, and profit across different categories and regions.

## Tools
- SQL for data queries (optional)
- Excel (pivot tables, charts)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for deeper analysis

## Deliverable
A report or notebook that analyzes sales data to determine top-performing categories, subcategories, regions, and profit drivers, using pivot tables and charts for visualization.

## Resume Line
